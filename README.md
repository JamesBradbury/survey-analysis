# survey-analysis
Simple bit of CSV-munging to answer some questions

This is been designed to analyse survey data from Wiltshire
Council with regard to cycling infrastructure, but it could
be used for any CSV that can be read with Python's CSV.DictReader.

Arguably most of this could be done more easily with a database, 
but where's the fun in that?
